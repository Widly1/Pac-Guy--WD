# Pac-Guy by WD
⭐️ Overview
Pac-Guy is a retro-inspired game based on the classic arcade game Pac-Man. This project was developed entirely from scratch using Python, though I leveraged various online tutorials, forums, and tools to guide me through the process. This marks my first step into the world of game development, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience.

⭐️ Development Journey
Creating Pac-Guy has taught me a lot about game programming, especially in terms of logic, collision detection, and file management. Some of the biggest challenges I faced included:
- Implementing **player-wall collision** to prevent movement through solid objects.
- Developing **player-ghost collision** to determine when a game-over event should occur.
- Creating a **high score system** that saves and retrieves scores from a file.

Despite these challenges, I managed to overcome them through trial, error, and research, further deepening my understanding of game mechanics.
⭐️ Future Enhancements
While Pac-Guy is playable in its current form, there are several improvements I plan to make in future updates, including:
- **AI Improvements**: Enhancing ghost movement beyond random navigation by implementing pathfinding algorithms.
- **Sound Effects & Music**: Adding audio to make gameplay more immersive.
- **Game Menu**: A proper menu system for starting, pausing, and exiting the game.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Introducing a two-player option for added fun.

⭐️ Lessons Learned
Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in:
- **Python programming for game development**
- **Collision detection and response**
- **File handling for storing game data**
- **Basic game loop and entity management**

This project has been a great foundation for my journey into game development, and I am excited to continue improving Pac-Guy and building even more games in the future.

⭐️ Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the online communities, tutorials, and resources that helped me navigate the complexities of game development. This project would not have been possible without the shared knowledge and support available online.

⭐️ How to Play 
1. Use the arrow keys or (AWSD control) to move Pac-Guy.
2. You can also pause the game using spacebar, (Don't mind the fact that the time doesn't fully stop when paused, will work on that bug and much more.)
3. Avoid ghosts while collecting all dots to progress.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
5. Have Fun :)

Stay tuned for future updates and enhancements!
